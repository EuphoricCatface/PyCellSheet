# PyCellSheet

A slightly more Pythonic spreadsheet, and a slightly more spreadsheet-like pyspread.  
A (hopefully) comfortable middle ground between the two.

A first Proof-of-Concept release of PyCellSheet, forked from pyspread v2.3.1.
Don't use this program for any job of importance yet!  
More detailed plans about the program is supposed to be can be found in `Application Design Notes.txt`.

Do I know what I'm doing? Heck, I don't even know how to properly package a Python program...
